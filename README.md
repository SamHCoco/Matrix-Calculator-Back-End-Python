#  Matrix Calculator: Overview of Capabilities

 This source code provides a command-line matrix calculator written in Python capable of performing
 the following calculations with matrices:

 * ADDITION: Two matrices, A and B, can be added once both matrices are created
 as objects and their values inputted by the user.

 * MULTIPLCATION: Using the Na√Øve Matrix Multiplication algorithm of summing products.

 * SCALAR MULTIPLCATION: Any matrix, A, may be multiplied by a scalar value, *x*,
 so that *x*\A.

 * DETERMINANT CALCULATION: Determinants of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices can be calculated.
